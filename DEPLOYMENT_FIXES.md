# 🚀 RoomLedger Deployment Fixes

RoomLedger now ships with a unified deployment story for both **Vercel** and **Netlify**. The fixes below make sure Supabase credentials load securely, the smart-settlement engine runs on whichever hosting provider you choose, and the frontend gracefully falls back when one endpoint is unavailable.

## ✅ Issues Resolved

1. **Supabase CDN** – Updated to the official `@supabase/supabase-js@2` CDN bundle.
2. **Environment variables** – Secure serverless bridges on both hosts:
   - `api/get-config.js` (Node.js on Vercel)
   - `netlify/functions/get-config.js` (Node.js on Netlify)
3. **Advanced settlement API** – Available everywhere:
   - `api/smart-settlement.js` (Node.js for Vercel)
   - `netlify/functions/smart-settlement.py` (Python for Netlify)
4. **Frontend fallbacks** – `index.html` now tries Vercel and Netlify endpoints automatically and shows clear guidance if credentials are missing.

## ☁️ Hosting Steps

### Deploy on Vercel
1. Set `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in **Project Settings → Environment Variables**.
2. Redeploy (via git push or **Deployments → Redeploy**).
3. Verify `https://<your-vercel-domain>/api/get-config` returns JSON and try the smart settlement button in the app.

### Deploy on Netlify
1. Set `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in **Site configuration → Build & deploy → Environment**.
2. Redeploy (git push or **Deploys → Trigger deploy → Deploy site**).
3. Confirm `https://<your-netlify-domain>/.netlify/functions/get-config` returns JSON and `/api/smart-settlement` resolves to the Python function.

## 🎯 Working End-to-End

- ✅ Latest Supabase SDK
- ✅ Secure config loading on both hosts
- ✅ Smart settlement API with cross-host fallback
- ✅ Helpful frontend error messaging when environment variables are missing
- ✅ Netlify headers, redirects, and runtime set up out of the box

Your RoomLedger deployment is now conflict-free and works seamlessly on Vercel or Netlify. 🎉
